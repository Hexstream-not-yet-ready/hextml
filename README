This library makes it easy to build a representation of HTML as lisp
objects, which you can then inspect/transform/output. There is an
included optimizer and compiler which produces highly efficient code.
A lot of code which would normally be considered "dynamic" is treated
as if it was "static" (ex: basic branching and looping).

It also includes a macro to directly output HTML with lisp code
embedded (the model currently used by most lisp HTML libraries).
Consecutive static strings are joined together into a single output
operation for efficiency and macroexpansion readability.

The syntax for both these modes (build VS output) is almost exactly
the same, resulting in less cognitive context-switching.


Of interest: in more than 99.5% of cases, you don't need to explicitly
re-enter the HTML context after having embedded dynamic lisp code, the
parsers figure it out automatically and reliably.


This library is in the Public Domain.
